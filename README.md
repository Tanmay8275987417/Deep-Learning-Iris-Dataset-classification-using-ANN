# **Classification of IRIS Flower using Artifical Neural Network**

## Information about Project

### Data Information

The IRIS dataset has 150 observations or Rows and 5 atttibutes or Columns of Iris Flowers.

First four columns are - **Sepal Length, Sepal Width , Petal Length, Petal Width**, all are in cm.

The Last column is containing the Classes - **['setosa' 'versicolor' 'virginica']**

**Classes are - [ 0 , 1 , 2 ] instead of ['setosa' 'versicolor' 'virginica'].**

### Model Building


Here  I have build sequential model of *Artificial Neural Network* with 4 inputs valuse with 2 hidden layers and Output layer.

1st hidden layer consist of 50 Neuron and relu activation function

2nd hidden layer consist of 50 Neuron and relu activation function and;

Output layer having 3 output followed by softmax activation function.
